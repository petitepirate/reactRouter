# Springboard 41.3 React History Exercise

We’ve built an app that lets people view and vote on cheesy jokes. To generate jokes, it uses the ICanHazDadJoke API.

When the page loads, the application fetches 10 jokes, making sure that no joke appears more than once on the page.

The application lists the jokes, along with a “vote-up” button, a “vote-down” button, and the net score (up - down) for each joke. Users can vote, and the net score updates.

Right now, the application is written using hooks and function components. Let’s refactor the app to use class components.

# This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
